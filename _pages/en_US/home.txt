## What is Homebrew?

[**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_video_games) usually refers to software that is not authorized by Game Developers. It allows you to run homebrew games, tools like save editing and backup, and emulators for various older systems.

In most cases, running homebrew on your device is 100% free. However there are always idiots wanting to make money. There are also various other exploits in commercial games and the browser to get homebrew running.

## What is Custom Firmware?

**Custom Firmware** ("CFW") enables you to use more advanced hacks that userland homebrew can't easily do. For instance, signature patches let you install unsigned titles that appear right on your HOME Menu.

As this exploitation method is USERLAND on the PS4, there will be a limit implied on Homebrew..

## What does this guide install?

This guide will teach you how to exploit your Playstation 4 console, Install a File Manager on your console, as well as give you Full System Access on your console. It will NOT Allow Piracy.
