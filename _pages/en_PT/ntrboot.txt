If you already flashed ntrboot to your flashcart, you can follow [Installing boot9strap (ntrboot)](installing-boot9strap-(ntrboot)) for instructions on how to use it.
{: .notice--success}

Installing boot9strap with ntrboot requires a compatible DS / DSi flashcart to flash ntrboot to.

The ntrboot exploit itself is compatible with the following flashcarts:

  + [R4i Gold 3DS RTS](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=149)
  + [Acekard 2i](http://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=160)

Note that specific methods may have additional compatibility information.

The usage of this exploit, regardless of flashing method, requires access to a small magnet if the target device is of a folding style (any 3DS family system that is not the old 2DS with a sleep switch). This is because the exploit requires your device to enter sleep mode while still having access to the buttons.

To test if a magnet will work, hold it on or around the (A)(B)(X)(Y) buttons while the device is powered on to see if it triggers sleep mode. If it does, both displays will go black as long as the magnet is held in that spot.
{: .notice--info}

Note that the flashcart will not be able to be used for its standard functions while the ntrboot exploit is installed on it (except for in the case of the Acekard 2i, which remains functional *on 3DS systems with custom firmware installed only*). There are optional steps at the end of the ntrboot flashing instructions to remove it from your flashcart when you are done.

Note that in some rare cases, it may be possible fer th' flashin' process to **brick** a counterfeit flashcart n' render it permanently unusable. 'Tis be unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts be supported. To reduce th' chance 'o recievin' a counterfeit card, it be recommended that ye use a reputable site to be buyin' ye flashcart (such as [NDS Card](http://www.nds-card.com/))
